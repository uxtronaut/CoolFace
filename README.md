## Dos

* If you see someone using `CoolFace.app` from the `Applications` folder on their computer, **DO** point it out and exclaim "Cool Face!"

* **DO** set `CoolFace.app` to start when you sign in. You can do this in System Preferences => Search for "Login Items" => + Button => Find `CoolFace.app` in the list and click "Add".

* **DO** check the `CoolFace.app` GitHub repo for updates on a regular basis to get the latest Cool Faces!

* **DO** practice the hotkeys! I bet with enough practice you can do them with just one hand!


## Don'ts

* If you see someone using `CoolFace.app` from their `Downloads` folder, **DON'T** shame them - just help them move the app and teach them about the advantages of a well-organized computer!

* **DON'T** forget that you can move forward and backward through the Cool Faces! Have you been practicing the hotkeys? Can you do them with one hand? You got it!

* **DON'T** use Cool Faces to bully people (especially the author of the app)! Some of the Cool Faces look pretty upset/angry - don't worry, they won't hurt you! I know this, so **DON'T** try and scare me with some angry Cool Face with his fists up!
